# How to log your hours?

* Step 1. Log in to Kronos: https://logon.timekeeping.ucsb.edu/wfc/navigator/logon or https://timekeeping.ucsb.edu

  * In this view, you can see all the hours ou logged for the current pay period. If you want to look at past pay periods, or set a custom range of dates you want to view the hitsory for, use the arrow in the top right corner.

* Step 3. In the next column, place the number of hours you would like to record for that day. It does not need to be an integer value.

* Step 5. At the end of the pay period, make sure the information you entered is accurate, and confirm the total number of hours worked (will be summed on the right). You then need to approve your timecard. Go to the top left corner, click on the checkmark, and sleect "Approva Timecard". The table will turn orange. Your timecard is then reviewed by your supervisor and the CS Department employee to write you a paycheck. You will normally get paid in 2 weeks minus two days since the end of a pay period.
